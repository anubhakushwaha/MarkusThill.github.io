<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>For many years now, researchers have been working on the question of whether and to what extent machines will ever be able to achieve a degree of intelligence similar to human intelligence. Many branches of research are concerned with the development of intelligent machines and computer programs that are designed to solve certain problems. In this context, the term artificial intelligence (AI) is often used. However, an exact or general definition of the term is difficult, since already when describing intelligence in general, very different views are taken. The well-known American computer scientist John McCarthy described the “artificial intelligence” as follows:</p>

<p><em>“It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence, but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable.”</em></p>

<p>In particular, the study and learning of strategic board games using computer programs has always played a prominent role from the point of view of research. A large number of studies - with the most various goals and solutions - in the last 70 years have been dealing extensively with the development of machine players. Particular attention was paid to the game of chess.
Already in 1769, Wolfgang von Kempelen, an Austrian-Hungarian civil servant, achieved fame with his “Mechanical Turk”. This was a machine that was supposedly able to play chess against human opponents with the help of a complex mechanism. Only later it turned out that a small human being could be hidden inside the machine, who used a special device to perform the moves.
The author of the first chess program is Konrad Zuse, who developed his program in the years 1942 to 1945 - using the self-designed programming language Plankalkül.
Since then, a great deal has happened in the field of artificial intelligence. The development reached a new peak with the victory of Deep Blue - a chess computer from IBM - against the reigning chess world champion Garri Kasparov. However, the enormous playing capability was achieved with the help of a massively parallel system, which was able to examine more than 2 million board positions per second.</p>

<p>Board games are not without reason one of the oldest and most researched areas of AI, some features make them particularly interesting for research:
Most strategic board games have a clear set of rules and a clearly defined goal (terminating condition; endlessly long games are generally not possible) that usually doesn’t change during the game. The rules and regulations can therefore normally be learned very easily or implemented in a program.
Nevertheless, it is often not possible to achieve the desired goal (e. g. “checkmating” of the opponent) without difficulty, since a whole series of actions is necessary for this; therefore, a statement about victory, defeat and draw can only be made after a sequence of actions. Although the set of rules limits the number of possible actions per move, non-trivial games can have an astronomically large number of possible move sequences, so that even a computer with massive performance cannot easily examine all combinations. Due to the enormous complexity of many games, a certain form of intelligence is therefore required to achieve acceptable playing strength.
Another point that distinguishes classic board games (with a few exceptions) from many other problems is that the complete environment (the board) is known at any moment of the game and also how individual actions affect the condition of the board.
Furthermore, the discrete game states of most board games simplify the implementation of the different algorithms.</p>

<p>An outstanding skill of the human being is that in many situations he is able to recognize certain characteristics or patterns and create similarities with other situations. For example, a person has no problem identifying known faces in a photo because he can memorize essential facial features and recall and compare them if necessary.
Even in board games, people can quickly recognize certain interrelationships and apply them successfully to new game situations. In the field of AI, it is much more difficult to recognize such patterns and to combine them in a suitable way to learn a game. Therefore, in the past, tree search methods were used very often and attempts were made to optimize the important parts (pruning of sub-trees etc.). However, such programs cannot “learn” the game in the classical sense of the word, but can simply search through a huge number of game situations in order to make an allegedly intelligent statement.
Many machine learning processes also depend on external “features” that tell the program which characteristics are of particular importance for the learning process. However, the selection and combination of suitable features is not trivial and often requires a high degree of creativity.</p>

<p>A suitable machine learning approach to learning strategic board games is Reinforcement Learning – especially Temporal Difference Learning (TDL) – where an agent tries to determine the usefulness of action sequences. After the end of the training games, the agent receives - depending on the outcome of the game - different rewards. In this way, the use of individual action sequences can be learned backwards during a certain number of training games. An important aspect here is the modeling of the value function, which is mainly required for position evaluation and ultimately for the assessment of individual actions.</p>

<p>But let us start first with classical search-tree-based approaches, before we move on to machine learning techniques in some later blog posts.</p>

<h2 id="connect-4">Connect-4</h2>
<p><em>Connect-4</em> is a popular board game for two players (typically <em>Yellow</em> and <em>Red</em>) played on a grid with seven columns and six rows. Initially, the board is completely empty so that 42 free positions are available. One main characteristic of the game is the vertical arrangement of the board, which restricts both players to only dropping their pieces into one of the seven columns (slots). Starting with Yellow, both players in turn drop one of their pieces into a slot of their choice. Under the force of gravity, the pieces then fall down to the lowest free position of the respective slot. If all six positions of a slot are occupied, it is not possible to place further pieces into this slot and the number of possible moves for both players is reduced by one.
Both opponents attempt to create a continuous line of four adjacent pieces with their color, either horizontally, vertically or, diagonally. The player who can achieve this first, wins the game. If none of the opponents is able to create a line of four with his own pieces during the 42 moves match, all columns will be completely filled and – according to the rules – the match ends with a tie. An example position for <em>Connect-4</em> is shown in the below figure.</p>

Both types of agents will be described in later posts. For the given position, Minimax is under zugzwang and will eventually loose the game, however, the defeat could be delayed as far as possible. </p>

<p>Although <em>Connect-4</em> has a medium state space complexity of around <script type="math/tex">4.5 \cdot 10^{12}</script> different positions <a class="citation" href="#Edelkamp08">[1]</a> and a game-tree complexity of approximately <script type="math/tex">10^{21}</script> <a class="citation" href="#Allis94">[2]</a>, solving the game remains a non-trivial task until today. The first solution was independently found by Allen <a class="citation" href="#Allen89">[3]</a> and Allis <a class="citation" href="#Allis88">[4]</a> in 1988. In their work the game was weakly solved; both could show – assuming perfect play of both opponents – that Yellow wins the game if she places her first piece in the center slot. Red on the other hand, can delay her defeat as far as possible to the end and force Yellow to use all her pieces.
In 1994, Tromp <a class="citation" href="#Tromp94">[5]</a> completed a database containing the game-theoretic values (win/loss/draw) of all non-trivial (Remark: Tromp considered all positions with an immediate threat as trivial. This may be true for positions with an immediate threat for Yellow, since she can win with her next move. However, immediate threats for Red can be neutralized by Yellow and the match would continue normally. This definition of triviality is therefore not completely correct.) positions with exactly 8 pieces, which strongly solved <em>Connect-4</em>. The evaluation of all <script type="math/tex">67,\,557</script> positions took him around <script type="math/tex">40,\,000</script> hours (<script type="math/tex">\approx 4.5</script> years).</p>

<p>In the following table, the number of leaf nodes and the state space complexity for a given number of plies is shown. With a maximum of 12 pieces (after 12 plies), the state space complexity is still about a factor of <script type="math/tex">2.5 \cdot 10^5</script> smaller than that of the complete game with up to 42 pieces (last value taken from <a class="citation" href="#Edelkamp08">[1]</a>).

<h2 id="a-connect-4-agent-based-on-tree-search-techniques">A Connect-4 Agent based on Tree-Search Techniques:</h2>
<h3 id="summary-of-the-following-blog-posts">Summary of the following Blog Posts</h3>

<p>Some time ago I developed a perfect playing <em>Connect-4</em> agent. I started with a simple <em>MiniMax</em> (simple tree search) agent and optimized the algorithm little by little. The resulting agent is based on advanced tree-search algorithms and is supported by extensive databases to master the opening phase of the game. For <em>Connect-4</em> we can make use of Tromp’s 8-ply opening-database. I extended Tromp’s database by all 8-ply positions with an immediate threat for yellow, since all positions with immediate threats were missing. Additionally, I generated a Huffman-encoded database containing all positions with 12 pieces, the expected outcome and the exact distance to the end of the game, assuming perfect play of both opponents.
The tree-search (<em>MiniMax</em> algorithm) in <em>Connect-4</em> is enhanced by alpha-beta pruning, move-ordering mechanisms, symmetries, two-stage transposition tables in order to identify identical positions created by permutations of a certain move sequence, Zobrist Hashing, Enhanced Transposition Cutoffs and more.</p>

<p>As the main underlying data-structure for the board-representation of <em>Connect-4</em> so called bit-boards are used. In this representation, each board cell (in <em>Connect-4</em>) can be represented by two bits in a bit-field. In total, <script type="math/tex">2 \times 42</script> bit are required to represent a <em>Connect-4</em> position (42 bit per player). If a suitable arrangement of all board cells in the bit-field is chosen, then many operations can be performed efficiently, since a modern CPU already provides many fast bit-wise instructions (AND, OR, XOR, bit- and byte-wise inversion, etc.). Frequently recurring operations on a board typically are: placing and removing pieces, mirroring and rotation, copying, identifying win/loss/draw situations and others. Many of these mentioned operations can be executed faster with bit-boards than with conventional data-structures such as arrays. For example, in <em>Connect-4</em>, the recognition of terminal states (4 pieces in a row) is a time-critical  operation, for which  an efficient solution by using bit-boards could be found. Another advantage of bit-boards is the memory-efficiency, which is especially beneficial when many board positions have to be stored in transposition tables.
Overall, our <em>MiniMax</em> agent for <em>Connect-4</em> is one of the fastest perfect-playing agents available: the empty board can be analyzed in less than 4 minutes on a Pentium-4 computer, without the support of the opening-database and using only a 24 MB transposition table. In the typical setup – with the 12-ply opening-database and a 24 MB transposition table – <em>MiniMax</em> can analyze each board position in fractions of a second.</p>

<p>These techniques will be explained in more details in the next couple of blog posts.</p>

<h2 id="connect-4-java-framework">Connect-4 Java Framework</h2>
<p>A software framework for <em>Connect-4</em> in <em>Java</em> is available on GitHub, which allows to conduct and perform learning experiments. A GUI is available, which provides visual inspection capabilities, evaluation tools, import/export functionalities, direct interaction between user and various agents (random, TDL, Minimax, Monte Carlo tree search) and more. The Java framework for <em>Connect-4</em> is available as open source from GitHub and can be downloaded from: <a href="http://github.com/MarkusThill/Connect-Four">http://github.com/MarkusThill/Connect-Four</a>.</p>
